Three-Machine Power System Model
================================

The machine-learning algorithms will be provided with the data generated from the dynamic simulation of the three-machine power system model. The model was built in Matlab/Simulink environment.
Its structure is shown in Fig. 1.

Power Flow Data
---------------
The base case data for the power flow calculations is shown in the following code snippet. The calculations can be run directly using a power flow solver provided with Simulink or by using `MATPOWER
<https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower>`_.

Data Set Generation
-------------------

Data set was generated by successive variations of operating conditions of a generator G2 (active and reactive powers) and estimations of a critical clearing time for a fault in the middle of the line between buses B1 and B3.
The processed data set is provided in the form of Comma-Separated Values file (*.csv) and can be found in the `repository <https://github.com/tinrabuzin/EH2745-CAPS/tree/master/src/datasets>`_.
